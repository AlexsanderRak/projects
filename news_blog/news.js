        "text": "Famous for designer brands like Valentino, Armani, Versace and Gucci, Italy scored a perfect 10 in being both ‘fashionable’ and ‘trendy’, which hardly surprises residents like Lucio Buffalmano, founder of the ThePowerMoves.com blog, who comes from Abruzzo, east of Rome. “It's a cliché, but Italians do care about what looks nice, and Italians do take more care than most in looking fashionable,” he said.",

Even when another country does something first, like the reality TV genre that started in the UK, the US is known for making it bigger and more popular worldwide. The country’s tech industry, home to Facebook, Twitter, Google and Amazon, has also left its mark, with billions of people interacting daily with these popular services and social networks.}",

The words of Frank Sinatra – “If I can make it there, I can make it anywhere” – still apply to the Big Apple, also known as the city that never sleeps. On the opposite coast, Hollywood in Los Angeles produces the entertainment that shapes culture in the US and beyond. “American TV shows and movies made here influence how we talk, dress, what we watch, and who we are,” Selepak said.

        "text": "The French take extreme pride in their identity that has shaped the world, and this includes the French language – which can be challenging for new expats. “Most people in France don't speak English, or broken English. Sometimes they do speak English, they just don't want to,” Fils said. “An expat will have to adapt to France, because French people won't make the effort to adapt to you.” ",
